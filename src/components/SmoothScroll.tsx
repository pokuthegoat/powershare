 *
 * REDUCED MOTION. With `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` Lenis is not created at all, so wheel, keyboard and
 * anchor scrolling are the browser's own, instant and untouched. The preference is followed live (turn it on or

 *  - Each frame calls lenis.raf(); the loop keeps going while Lenis reports it is smooth-scrolling and stops the
 *    moment the glide has settled. At rest there is no timer, listener work or animation frame at all.
 *  - Lenis measures each step from the previous frame's timestamp. After a sleep that gap is huge and the first step
 *    would jump straight to the target, so on wake the clock is reset to one frame ago. "One frame" is the interval
 *    measured during the last glide, so the first step matches the rest on 60, 144 or 240 Hz screens alike.
 *
 * Touch, keyboard and scrollbar scrolling stay native and never wake it (Lenis just follows the browser's position).
