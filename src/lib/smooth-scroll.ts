 * HOW THE WHEEL FEELS. Every wheel notch moves a target position by `wheelMultiplier` x its delta, and the page
 * glides from where it is to that target over a fixed WHEEL_DURATION, on an exponential ease-out: fast at first,
 * then a long soft landing. A new notch mid-glide restarts the glide toward the new, further target, so spinning the
 * wheel builds speed and stopping it leaves a coast. The scroll-linked background (SceneBackground.tsx) reads the
 * page's scroll position every frame, so it moves with exactly this glide.
